Using putty instead of the ssh command
The course is explained using MacOS/Linux. If you rather want to use putty, use the following steps to create your SSH keypair:

Download Putty and PuttyGen from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Launch PuttyGen and click the "Generate" button to generate a new public/private key
You can enter a passphrase or leave it blank
Save the public and private keys by clicking the Save public key and Save private key buttons
